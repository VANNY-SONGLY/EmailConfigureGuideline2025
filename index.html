      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Mozilla Thunderbird is a free, open-source email client and personal information manager developed by
        MZLA Technologies Corporation,
        a subsidiary of <br> the Mozilla Foundation, offering features like a calendar, contact book, RSS feed reader,
        chat client, and news client.
      </p>

      <img src="Image/introduction.png" alt="">

      <h2 style="margin-top: 35px;">Setup</h2>
      <p>
        Upon loading Thunderbird, you will be presented with your local folder list. In this menu, you will be able to
        add your email account to the email client.
      </p>

      <img src="Image/setup 1.png" style="width: auto;" height="auto" alt="">

      <p>
        Automatic Email Account Setup
      </p>

      <p>
        To add your email account to the email client, go to the Local Folders tab which should be displayed by the
        email client. Select the Create a new account <br>
        section and press the email button. Press the button at the bottom of the window marked Skip this and use my
        existing mail to add our existing account to the email client.
      </p>

      <img src="Image/setup 2.png" style="width: auto;" height="auto" alt="">

      <p>
        This will now bring up a window whereby we can enter our email account settings. There are several fields which
        you are <br> required to complete in order to connect to your email account:
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 25px; font-size: 14px;">◉ Your name: This should be your full name.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px; font-size: 14px;">◉ Email Address: This should be
        your email address.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px; font-size: 14px;">◉ Password: This should be the
        password you would use to log in to your email account.</p>

      <p>Press the continue button to continue.</p>

      <img src="Image/setup 3.png" style="width: auto;" height="auto" alt="">

      <p>
        The email server and account details are listed in this window. Verify that these details are correct for your
        email server and if so, press the Done button.
      </p>

      <img src="Image/setup 4.png" style="width: auto;" height="auto" alt="">

      <p>
        Manual Email Account Setup
      </p>

      <p>
        If you wish to manually connect to your email account from the Thunderbird client, you must first attempt to
        connect to it automatically. Please refer to the <br>
        Automatic Email Account Setup section for steps to do this. Once you reach the final screen in the automatic
        setup, press the Manual config button at the bottom of the window.
      </p>

      <img src="Image/setup 5.png" style="width: auto;" height="auto" alt="">

      <p>
        Here you can change all of the email server settings which were imported automatically by Thunderbird. Once you
        have entered the correct email server <br>
        and account details, press the Done button. In this window, there are more fields which need to
        be completed in order to manually connect to your email account.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incoming Server
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 25px; font-size: 14px;">◉ Protocol: If you are connecting to your email
        account using multiple devices, you should choose IMAP. If you are connecting to your email account using one
        device, you should choose POP3.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px; font-size: 14px;">◉ Host name: This should be as
        follows, mail. ＜YOUR DOMAIN NAME＞.co.uk. Example: mail.jtresponse.co.uk.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px; font-size: 14px;">◉ Port: This should already be
        completed.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 10px;">Create Rule</p>

      <img src="Image/setup 6.png" style="width: auto;" height="auto" alt="">

      <p>
        Click on your email account in the sidebar to the left of the window. Press the Manage message
        filters button under the Advanced Features heading on the page.
      </p>

      <img src="Image/setup 7.png" style="width: auto;" height="auto" alt="">

      <p>To create a new rule, press the New button.</p>

      <img src="Image/setup 8.png" style="width: auto;" height="auto" alt="">

      <p>
        This window will display all of the information about the rule you are creating. At the top of the window, you
        can enter the name of the filter you wish to create. <br>
        Below this, you can specify when the filter is run and whether the filter is run before or after junk
        classification.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first box is a list of conditions that a message must meet to activate the rule. There are several options
        as to whether messages must meet all of the conditions or whether they can meet only one or more of the
        conditions in order to activate the rule.
        The first drop down contains the type of condition which is to be met. The second drop down specified what
        condition is being applied to the condition type. The final box is used to specify the exact condition which
        must be met. The plus button will add a new condition and the minus button will remove a rule.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second box is a list of actions which will be taken on messages which meet the conditions. These actions are
        the WHAT part of the rule, specifying what action is taken on messages which meet the conditions. The first drop
        down contains a list of action types.
        The second drop down is used to further specify what action is taken. The plus button is used to add new actions
        to the rule. The minus button is used to remove actions from the rule.
      </p>

      <p>
        Press the OK button to enable the rule within your email client.

        Summary
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope that this guide will help you to setup, configure and use Mozilla Thunderbird. Most of the steps
        taken in this guide should be similar for other versions of Thunderbird but I cannot guarantee this, therefore
        if you are using a different version, please follow these steps at your own risk. If you have any questions
        about this guide, please comment below and I will be happy to assist you.
